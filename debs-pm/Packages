Description: building, finding and using wxWidgets binaries
 This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon,
 designed to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for
 module authors.
 .
 If Locale::Maketext::Lexicon is not present, it implements a
 minimal localization function by simply interpolating [_1] with
 the first argument, [_2] with the second, etc.  Interpolated
 function like [quant,_1] are treated as [_1], with the sole
 exception of [tense,_1,X], which will append ing to _1 when
 X is present, or appending ed to <_1> otherwise.

Description: provide framework for multiple event loops
 AnyEvent provides an identical interface to multiple event loops. This
 allows module authors to utilise an event loop without forcing module
 users to use the same event loop (as only a single event loop can coexist
 peacefully at any one time).
 .
 The interface itself is vaguely similar but not identical to the Event
 module.
 .
 On the first call of any method, the module tries to detect the currently
 loaded event loop by probing wether any of the following modules is
 loaded: Coro::Event, Event, Glib, Tk. The first one found is
 used. If none is found, the module tries to load these modules in the
 order given. The first one that could be successfully loaded will be
 used. If still none could be found, AnyEvent will fall back to a pure-perl
 event loop, which is also not very efficient.

Description: Methods for core built-in functions in primitive types
 Methods wrapping perl's built-in functions for minipulating numbers, strings, arrays,
 hashes, and code references. It can be handy to use built-in functions as methods to avoid
 messy dereferencing syntaxes and parentheses pile ups.
 .
 autobox lets you call methods in scalars that aren't object references.
 Numbers, strings, scalars containing numbers, scalars containing strings,
 array references, hash references, and code references all work as objects.
 autobox adds this feature to perl but does not itself provide any
 methods to call. That is left to the user or another module. For example,
 this module.
 .
 autobox::Core is what you'd call a stub module. It is merely glue, presenting
 existing functions with a new interface. Most of the methods read like
 sub hex ($) { hex($_[0]) }.
 Besides built-ins that operate on hashes, arrays, scalars, and code references,
 some Perl 6-ish things were thrown in, and some keyword like foreach have
 been turned into methods.

 This module was mainly written for Net::XMPP2, Net::IRC3 and BS

 Even though I originally wrote it for those modules I relased it seperately
 in case anyone may find this module useful.
 .
 For more comprehensive event handling see also Glib and POE.
 .
 This class provides a simple way to extend a class, by inheriting from
 this class, with an event callback interface.
 .
 You will be able to register callbacks for event names and call them later.
 .
 This class is only really useful if you derive from it.

 .
 The action will be executed inside a txn_do, and a die inside that
 method will cause the transaction to be rolled back, as documented in
 DBIx::Class::Schema.
 .
 This method will not, on the other hand, handle that exception, since
 txn_do will rethrow it. This means that this handling is not much
 intrusive in the action processing flow.

 Role based access control is very simple: every user has a list of roles,

 makes an assertion about the necessary roles.

 With assert_user_roles, if the user is a member in all of the required
 roles access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied. With
 assert_any_user_role it is enough that the user is a member in one
 role.
 .
 For example, if you have a CRUD application, for every mutating action you
 probably want to check that the user is allowed to edit. To do this, create an
 editor role, and add that role to every user who is allowed to edit.
 .
 sub edit : Local {
 my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
 $c->assert_user_roles( qw/editor/ );
 $c->model("TheModel")->make_changes();

Description: the only real threads in perl
 For a tutorial-style introduction, please read the Coro::Intro
 manpage. This manpage mainly contains reference information.
 .
 This module collection manages continuations in general, most often in
 the form of cooperative threads (also called coros, or simply "coro"
 in the documentation). They are similar to kernel threads but don't (in
 general) run in parallel at the same time even on SMP machines. The
 specific flavor of thread offered by this module also guarantees you that
 it will not switch between threads unless necessary, at easily-identified
 points in your program, so locking and parallel access are rarely an
 issue, making thread programming much safer and easier than using other
 thread models.
 .
 Unlike the so-called "Perl threads" (which are not actually real threads
 but only the windows process emulation ported to unix, and as such act
 as processes), Coro provides a full shared address space, which makes
 communication between threads very easy. And Coro's threads are fast,
 too: disabling the Windows process emulation code in your perl and using
 Coro can easily result in a two to four times speed increase for your
 programs. A parallel matrix multiplication benchmark runs over 300 times
 faster on a single core than perl's pseudo-threads on a quad core using
 all four cores.

Description: Parse and format Oracle dates and timestamps
 This module may be used to convert Oracle date and timestamp values
 into DateTime objects.  It also can take a DateTime object and
 produce a date string matching the NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
 .
 Oracle has flexible date formatting via its NLS_DATE_FORMAT session
 variable.  Date values will be returned from Oracle according to the
 current value of that variable.  Date values going into Oracle must also
 match the current setting of NLS_DATE_FORMAT.
 .
 Timestamp values will match either the NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT or
 NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT session variables.
 .
 This module keeps track of these Oracle session variable values by
 examining environment variables of the same name.  Each time one of
 Oracle's formatting session variables is updated, the %ENV hash
 must also be updated.

 Every time a client binds to a resource, this plugin will record that
 trial and return a different resource, including a sufix in the #999
 format. The original JID will be saved as a load balancing
 endpoint. Other clients then can try to bind to the same resource, and
 will also be assigned different JIDs, but all that will be recorded.
 .
 If some client, on the other hand, tries to bind to the resource of
 another real client (already with the #999 sufix), the bind will be
 denied.

Description: Locate per-dist and per-module shared files
 The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion to
 Class::Inspector and File::HomeDir, modules that take a
 process that is well-known by advanced Perl developers but gets a
 little tricky, and make it more available to the larger Perl community.
 .
 Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise)
 to have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored
 on the file-system at run-time.
 .
 On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share,
 however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so
 the use of any one location is unreliable.
 .
 Perl provides a little-known method for doing this, but almost
 nobody is aware that it exists. As a result, module authors often
 go through some very strange ways to make the data available to
 their code.

 HTML::FormFu is a HTML form framework which aims to be as easy as

 do anything else you might want to do (as long as it involves forms).
 .
 You can configure almost any part of formfu's behaviour and output. By
 default formfu renders "XHTML 1.0 Strict" compliant markup, with as little
 extra markup as possible, but with sufficient CSS class names to allow for a
 wide-range of output styles to be generated by changing only the CSS.
 .
 All methods listed below (except /new) can either be called as a normal
 method on your $form object, or as an option in your config file. Examples
 will mainly be shown in YAML config syntax.

 This documentation follows the convention that method arguments surrounded
 by square brackets [] are optional, and all other arguments are
 required.

Description: copy Regexp objects
 Regexp::Copy allows you to copy the contents of one Regexp object to another.
 A problem that I have found with the qr// operator is that the Regexp objects that
 it creates are is impossible to dereference.  This causes problems if you want to change
 the data in the regexp without losing the reference to it.  Its impossible.  Regexp::Copy
 allows you to change the Regexp by copying one object created through qr// to another.
 .
 This module came about through discussions on the London.pm mailing list in regards to
 attempts various people had made to serialize objects with qr// created Regexp objects in
 them.  The Regex::Copy distribution also loads Regexp::Storable, which provides hooks to
 allow the Storable persistence method to freeze and thaw Regexp objects created by qr//.

 This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of resource

 the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to a subroutine that is guaranteed to
 be called even if the thread of execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows
 lexically-scoped "promises" to be made that are automatically honoured by perl's garbage
 collector.

Description: Compare two strings and return how much they are alike
 This module was created when I needed to merge the information
 between two databases, and I had to find who were who in each database,
 but the names weren't always equals, sometimes there were differences.
 .
 The problem was that I need to choose the right person, so I must see how
 much the different names are alike. I've tried testing char by char, but situations
 like the described in the synopsis showed me that wasn't enough. So I created a
 set of tests to give a more accurate pontuation of how much the  names are alike.

Description: Associate user-defined magic to variables from Perl.
 Magic is Perl way of enhancing objects.
 This mechanism lets the user add extra data to any variable and hook syntaxical operations (such as access, assignment or destruction) that can be applied to it.
 With this module, you can add your own magic to any variable without having to write a single line of XS.
 .
 You'll realize that these magic variables look a lot like tied variables.
 It's not surprising, as tied variables are implemented as a special kind of magic, just like any 'irregular' Perl variable : scalars like $!, $( or $^W, the %ENV and %SIG hashes, the @ISA array,  vec() and substr() lvalues, threads::shared variables...
 They all share the same underlying C API, and this module gives you direct access to it.
 .
 Still, the magic made available by this module differs from tieing and overloading in several ways :
